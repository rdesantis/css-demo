                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>
                    Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes
                    served with a modern twist. The chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture and have a menu of
                    12â€“15 items that they rotate seasonally. The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices,
                    making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.
                </p>

                    Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their
                    shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy.
                    Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate
                    additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
